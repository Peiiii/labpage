		<p>Organic small molecules make up the vast majority of medicines, 
		biological probes, agrochemicals, and materials building blocks. 
		Thus, though they are ubiquitous in modern society, many classes 
		of small molecules remain problematic to prepare using conventional methods.
		Contemporary synthetic routes routinely require multiple steps, generate 
		large quantities of waste, or require substantial human energy to troubleshoot. 
		Research in the Engle group focuses on addressing these challenges 
		by harnessing the power of catalysis. Our groupâ€™s goal is to 
		advance the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of 
		chemical synthesis. The projects that we tackle are highly interdisciplinary,
		and as a consequence, students complement their core training in synthetic
		organic, physical organic, and organometallic chemistry with expertise in related 
		disciplines in and outside of chemistry.
